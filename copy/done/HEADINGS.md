We are crafting unique software solutions. We transform a set of business requirements into a 
working, living product under a realistic timeline.

For a fully delivered solution we consider a combination of the milestones below:

- System architecture
- UI/UX design
- Web / mobile frontends
- Backend and backend logic
- Hosting, deployment. 
- Guidelines and documentation. 
- Testing and future maintenance.

We are ready to deliver full sets of requirements, however we also accept assignment for partial development. Sometimes an MVP is much simpler than all of it. We know this. Therefore each case is handled individually.

We are a fully remote company based in Poland, Europe. We are opened for onsite cooperating, consultations, trainings and integrations. However at the moment, we prefer to work remotely. We are based in GMT +1, but we are not scared to work with someone from different time zones. We can adjust the working hours based on the mutual agreements. We are always accessible, communicate a lot, and love automating slack channels.

We are a software engineering company, but we also have experience managing small and medium teams. That is why we are also opened for building process, educating existing team members, consultation in project management. We are here to help level up your team, we love impact!

We have a recommended set of technologies, what can achieve a really fast MVP, but able to scale well both horizontally and vertically. Our stack is based on "javascript", and considered to be very progressive. We love new stuff, but we understand the importance of legacy systems as well. We learn fast, adapt easily, and happy to face challenging technologies outside of our comfort zone.
