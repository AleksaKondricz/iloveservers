# I Love Servers 🌏💻

Software development house static page developed with Gatsby.js. 

## Getting Started ##

Download the repository. You can run in development locally with hot-reload, or build the pages.

#### Prerequisites ####
  * [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) - Static site generator, global install needed
  * [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Packet manager (installs together with nodeJS)
  * [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - nodeJS logic
  
#### Installing ####
   *A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running*.
   
   __Make sure You have nodeJS and NPM installed.__
   
```
node --version
npm --version
```

If one of them fails somehow, then You dont have them installed. Download the newest version [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Check and install GATSBY framework globally if You havent done it yet.

```
gatsby --version
npm install -g gatsby
```

Install the related dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Running in development

Run in dev with hot-reload. Useful when defining the product page templates.

```
npm run dev
```

## Running a build

```
npm run build
```

```
npm run serve
```

Run serve after the build. This is the built version. This is what will be served for the users. It may differ from `npm run dev` please, always test your changes in this way too.

## Linting

Use ESLINT config in the root. How You lint is optional, I can recommend lint on save functionality in VSC.

We are using EsLINT + prettier combo. Set up AUTOSAVE in Visual Studio Code:

`File > Preferences > Settings > Text Editor > Formatting > Format On Save` please have it turned on

`File > Preferences > Settings > Extensions > ESLint > Auto Fix On Save` please have it turned on

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Writing front-end components
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) - Static site generator
- CSS
